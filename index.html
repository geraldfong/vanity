	<div class="content"> My name is Gerald Fong. I am a Freshmen EE/CS major at UC Berkeley and I am passionate about startups. When I am not programming or organizing events with <a class="hackLink" href="http://www.hackersatberkeley.com">HackersAtBerkeley(H@B)</a>, I compose piano songs. Below are a list of my past projects.</div>

	<div class="content"> <h2>Facebook Hackathon: Finger Tracking</h2> </div>

    I worked in a team of four to create a Java application to track the movement of indiviudal
    fingers in order to control the computer and recognize handwriting. We used the infrared camera
    from the Wii remote along with hand-wired Infrared Lights (IR) and reflective tape. We successfully
    implemented the finger tracking process so that we could browse and control the mouse by using
    different gestures such as putting two fingers together or introducing an additional finger to
    change mode. We were able to implement algorithms to also calibrate and track a person's handwriting,
    but it was too computational intensive due to the dynamic time warping technique that we used.
    
    We placed second place at the Facebook battle of the bay hackathon. My team consisted of algorithm
    master Sharad Vikram, hardware expert Siddarth Bhattacharya and GUI creator Justin Fu.

      The Splash Mobile App is a way for people to efficiently and simply arrange hangouts and meetups
      without the hassle that many of the modern day systems have today. It is also able to include
      users that do not have smart phone with text messaging support. This product was the collaboration
      of a group of Lynbrook High School (LHS) Alumnis including Sebastian Liu of New York University,
      Ryan Liu and Ashwin Raman of University of Chicago, Jason Pang of UC Davis, and me. I designed
      and wrote the backend servers while Jason Pang wrote the client side android application. The
      graphics were done by current LHS senior Diane Wang.
    </p>
    <p>
      This application was built completely on Java. I wrote the server which consisted of a handmade
      Rest API that interacted using JSON. The server as put in an Amazon EC2 Instance. I used the
      Jetty Application Server and MySQL database backend.

    During my junior year of High School just after learning Data Structures and Object Oriented
    Programming (OOP), I led a team of three to create this aim and fire physics basics game.
    My groupmembers for the project were Aditya Majumdar, current Columbia Student, and Kevin Heh,
    a current Stanford student. 
    </br>
    I designed the project which consisted of a life-like physics engine with randomly varying 
    graphics. The front end was built on the Javax Swing library. The project in total had over 30 
    images and 50 classes. We also implemented complex inheritence chains for items such as upgrades
    and additional weapons, or different missile types.
