    I was born and raised in Saratoga of Silicon Valley and recently graduated from Lynbrook High School
    as Valedictorian and Graduation Speaker. During my time at Lynbrook, I was an officer of the Model United Nations, a ASB and Class Officer,
    and also the founder and president of the Piano Club. I tried a lot of different clubs including
    water polo, tennis, and marching band. I basically participated in everything in highschool except for 
    computer science. The clubs and events for it outside of the classroom were never very intriguing
    to me.

      One day, my dad read in a chinese newspaper that a guy by the name of Yu-Kai Chou would be
      speaking in Mountain View about Social Media and its worth in society today. Thinking it was
      free and couldn't hurt, I told him, sure I would come. He signed me up for it and neglected
      to tell me that it actually costed $40. On the way there, when he told me that it costed that 
      much, I got mad at him because I didn't think it would be worth it to go that far on a weekday 
      (and I had a massive homework assignment due the next day),
      but since there was no reinbursement policy, I decided to just go. At the event, I turned out
      to be the only person below the age of forty and it was there that I first got to meet Yu-Kai
      Chou, entrepreneur extraordinaire. He cracked some jokes and had some enlightning things to say
      about how thigns that I usually look at as consumer media can actually be leveraged by companies
      and individuals alike. That day by coincidence, I had my resume on me and I handed it to him. I told him I was intending
      on pursuing CS and had no clue what to expect. 
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next few days, I exchanged contacts with him and eventually got an interview with the
      Cheif Product Officer (CPO), Stephen Johnson. The next thing I knew, during that summer
      I began interning full time with them and had a blast working on what was truly interesting
      and satisfying. I desgined and developed a Data Warehouse on top of Hadoop (HDFS) and HBase
      that is now being used in production code. The expert-learning hybrid algorithm that 
      gauranteed O(1) queries in exchange for inserts I had created is also patent pending. What more
      could I ask for during my first 3 months out of highschool?

      It was there I also started to learn a lot more about the startup world. The culture was pure amazingness.
      There was no morning trudge to work. It just felt natural going back and building new things. The
      hours flew by quickly and the bugs, although troublesome, were never too discouraging with the
      help of Stephen. It was then that I realized that the Start-up culture could potentially be a
      fit for me, even with all the risk thats associated.

    I am now a freshmen at UC Berkeley majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS).
    I must say that thing that has stuck out to me the most is that there are some truly talented
    and awesome individuals in the school that I am very glad I have met. In particular, the main thing
    that I've been doing as late has been helping to build the Hackers@Berkeley Club that started
    Fall of 2011.
